## AR-for-CPR

### Project Description
AR CPR Trainer

Myself (Esther Putman) and Isha Kanu have teamed up to develop an Augmented Reality CPR trainer. Our idea is that many people are nervous to perform CPR, even if they are trained, because they fear they don't fully know the instructions. A mixed reality display like HoloLens could be kept as a part of AED devices to guide civilians through performing CPR in emergency scenarios. We plan to develop an AR environment that displays the Red Cross CPR instructions including scene safety, calling 911, checking airway, and performing compressions. The pace for compressions could be provided as an audio or visual aid. We have access to a HoloLens we plan to use for demonstration. We would develop this environment in Unity using Microsoft's Mixed reality toolkit.

### Instructions for CPR
Sourced from the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/cpr/performing-cpr/cpr-steps)

1. **Scene Safety** : Check the scene and the person. Make sure the scene is safe, then tap the person on the shoulder and shout "Are you OK?" to ensure that person needs help.
2. **Call 911** : If that person needs help, you (or a bystander) should call 911. 
3. **Open the Airway** : With the person lying on their back, tilt thir head back slightly to lift the chin.
4. **Check for breathing** : Listen carefully, for no more than 10 seconds, for sounds of breating. (Occasional gasping sounds do not equate to breathing. If there is no breathing, begin CPR.
5. **Start compressions**. Push hard, push fast. Place your hands, one on top of the other, in the middle of the chest. USe your body weight to help you administer compressions that are at atleast 2 inches deep and delivered at a rate of atleast 100 beats per minute.
> This is where we will present instructions on compression rate in either audio beats or a visual of the rate (or both!), as well as provide feedback on compression depth using planes and HoloLens hand tracking.
7. Continue CPR steps. Keep performing cycles fo chest compressions and breathing until the person exhibits signs of life, such as breathing, or when EMS or a trained medical responder arrives on the scene.
